Day 1:
    1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
        We use Git to make it easier to collaborate with other developers. Git ensures there are no code conflicts between developers. 

    2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
    The main benefit of having multiple branches is that you can set one branch to be your "live" branch that the consumer sees. You can set an alternate branch to be the main branch that you develop new changes for instead of jeopardizing the main branch. 

    3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
    Git is a way to create a local repository. GitHub takes a local repository and makes it remote to make it avaliable to other developers to work on the same projects. 
Day 2:
    1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
        
        A pseudo-class is something that gives a special state to an object. I think we'll use the pseudo-class a.link{} and a.visited{} a lot to show customers if they've used a link previously or not.

    2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
        
        Specificity is more or less "importance" in the code. For example, if you have an object with both the color red and the color blue applied to it, if the color red has a higher specificity, the object will be red instead of blue.

    3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
        I think one of the issues you could run into is that if everything is listed as !important then nothing becomes important or they all fight constantly over dominance and it could cause a lot of specificity issues in your code.
Day 3: 
    1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
        I think the best tip in the resource is the section on adding highlights. I don't think a lot of people realize how much highlighting adds to anything.
    2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
        I always look for good color palette websites as apposed to just color pickers because it gives you a full palette to work with. I like to use coolors.co mostly. There are other good ones out there though. 

    3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
        I think what I said in the first question can be applied more broadly to thsi one. I really don't think people appreciate what art and design brings to everyday life. So when I hear people complain that art is useless or whatever, it makes me feel kind of bad for them because they clearly just don't understand.
Day 4:
    1.What is the purpose of wire-framing?
        Wireframing is meant to break down what your website needs into smaller pieces. This way, when you go to build your website you don't get bogged down in the decision making of what it should look like or what the website should do. 

    2.What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
        The different kinds of wire-framing are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity. LF is useful for quick ideas and general placement, and high fidelity is useful for very accurate and very clear near-finished level of visaul development. Mid-fidelity would act as a middle point between the two.

    3.Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
        Wireframing is a lot like doing thumbnail sketching for art, in my opinion, which ultimately is required for higher complexity illustrations or for figuring out your ideas. I don't see why you wouldn't at least do a basic low-fidelity wireframing if you have the time.
