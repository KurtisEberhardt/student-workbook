1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    We use Git to make it easier to collaborate with other developers. Git ensures there are no code conflicts between developers. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
The main benefit of having multiple branches is that you can set one branch to be your "live" branch that the consumer sees. You can set an alternate branch to be the main branch that you develop new changes for instead of jeopardizing the main branch. 

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
Git is a way to create a local repository. GitHub takes a local repository and makes it remote to make it avaliable to other developers to work on the same projects.
