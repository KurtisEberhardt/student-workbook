Day 1:
    1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
        We use Git to make it easier to collaborate with other developers. Git ensures there are no code conflicts between developers. 

    2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
    The main benefit of having multiple branches is that you can set one branch to be your "live" branch that the consumer sees. You can set an alternate branch to be the main branch that you develop new changes for instead of jeopardizing the main branch. 

    3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
    Git is a way to create a local repository. GitHub takes a local repository and makes it remote to make it avaliable to other developers to work on the same projects. 
Day 2:
    1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
        
        A pseudo-class is something that gives a special state to an object. I think we'll use the pseudo-class a.link{} and a.visited{} a lot to show customers if they've used a link previously or not.

    2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
        
        Specificity is more or less "importance" in the code. For example, if you have an object with both the color red and the color blue applied to it, if the color red has a higher specificity, the object will be red instead of blue.

    3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
        I think one of the issues you could run into is that if everything is listed as !important then nothing becomes important or they all fight constantly over dominance and it could cause a lot of specificity issues in your code.
