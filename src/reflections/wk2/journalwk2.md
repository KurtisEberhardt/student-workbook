day one: 
1. What is Scope ?
    
    Scope means where in the code a variable can be used. var for example is globally scoped which means the data it holds can be accessed anywhere
2. What is Hoisting ?
    
    Hoisting allows you to move variables and function declarations to the top of their scope before the 
    code executed. This results in the code result being undefined when it is executed. 

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
    
    Let is preferable to const and var for most general situations. Const would be used when the data a variable holds can't be changed or shouldn't be changed. 

day two: 
1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
    The three ways to write a function are: 
        function xyz(abc){}
        let dgf = function(xyz) {}
        let lmo = (stuff) => {}


2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
    Parameters are placeholders in functions that basically declare that you need to pass data into the function. Arguments are the data passed into the function itself. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
    A higher order function is a function that takes an arguement or returns a function itself. 
    function abc(xyz){
        dgf()
    }
day three: 
1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
    
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML? 
    The Elements tab can access the CSS and HTML from the console. This can be useful to adjust CSS classes live to see what they look like and you can click directly on elements to bring yourself to the code.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    A better way of debugging your code would be adding a debugger; into your code right before what you're having issues with. This allows you to have greater control over your debugging process. 
day four: 
1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
